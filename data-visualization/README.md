# Data Visualization Projects

This directory contains implementations of the Data Visualization certification projects from FreeCodeCamp. All projects use D3.js for creating interactive data visualizations.

## Projects Implemented

### 1. Bar Chart (`bar-chart/`)
- **Description**: Visualizes US GDP data from 1947-2015 using a bar chart
- **Data Source**: FreeCodeCamp GDP dataset
- **Features**:
  - Interactive bars with hover tooltips
  - Time-based X-axis (years)
  - GDP values on Y-axis
  - Responsive design
  - Professional styling

### 2. Scatterplot Graph (`scatterplot-graph/`)
- **Description**: Scatter plot showing doping allegations in professional cycling
- **Data Source**: FreeCodeCamp cyclist data
- **Features**:
  - Interactive dots with hover tooltips
  - Time vs. ranking scatter plot
  - Color-coded doping allegations
  - Professional styling with legend

### 3. Heat Map (`heat-map/`)
- **Description**: Heat map visualization of global temperature data
- **Data Source**: FreeCodeCamp global temperature dataset
- **Features**:
  - Monthly temperature variance by year
  - Color-coded temperature differences
  - Interactive tooltips
  - Gradient legend

### 4. Force Directed Graph (`force-directed-graph/`)
- **Description**: Force-directed graph showing movie sales connections
- **Data Source**: FreeCodeCamp movie data
- **Features**:
  - Interactive draggable nodes
  - Genre-based coloring
  - Force simulation physics
  - Hover tooltips with movie details

### 5. Choropleth Map (`map-data-globe/`)
- **Description**: Choropleth map showing US education attainment by county
- **Data Source**: FreeCodeCamp education dataset
- **Features**:
  - County-level education data visualization
  - Color-coded bachelor's degree percentages
  - Interactive county tooltips
  - Professional legend

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: Primary library for data visualization
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Structure and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Data manipulation and interactivity
- **FreeCodeCamp APIs**: Data sources for all visualizations

## Running the Projects

Each project is self-contained and can be run by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. The projects fetch data from FreeCodeCamp's APIs and render interactive visualizations.

## FreeCodeCamp Certification

These implementations fulfill the requirements for the Data Visualization certification from FreeCodeCamp.

## Project Status

- ✅ Bar Chart - Completed
